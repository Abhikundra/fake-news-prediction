# fake-news-prediction
### 1. Introduction
We can understand fake news as misleading information, gossip, rumours, selective information which are not verified by an authentic source that people assume to be true and could be deceived by it easily. Fake news could be propagated through various media. For now, social media like Whatsapp, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram has become the top platforms where fake news could be spread easily.
Why do we care so much about fake news?
In recent times we have witnessed various unlawful events like mob lynching of a person happen just because of a piece of false information about him spread so quickly on Whatsapp and other social media platforms which caused that particular event to happen.
In February 2019 communal riots happened in Delhi, fake news plays an important role to increase its intensity by misleading a specific audience. Which caused the loss of human lives.Fake news is also used as a campaign strategy  to propagate specific information or run propaganda against fellow contenders.
To overcome some of these major problems it is necessary to check whether the news is reliable or unreliable.

### 2. Business Problem
Spreading of fake news and misleading information can eventually cause confusion and rumours circulating and the victims of it could be badly impacted by this. So it is very important for social media platforms on which news is published to take proper steps to identify whether the news is reliable or not and flag it.

### 3. Business Constraints
The cost of misclassification is very high. As false positives and false negatives can affect very much. 
Model interpretability is more important as we want to know why a particular news article is reliable or not reliable. 
We want our model to be fast as it can predict whether the news is reliable or not,  just after it is published.

### 4. Problem Statement
We can project the above problem to binary classification to predict whether the news published is reliable or unreliable.
